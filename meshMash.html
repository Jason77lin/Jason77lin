  <pre><p><h5>         My collage displayed on this screen is intended to project a very apocalyptic and malevolent beginning. The colors of my collage are somewhat dim,<br>      the sun is setting and the stories of monsters you were told of as a child have come true. The reason for the making of this collage is that I've always <br>      been interested in the supernatural, even if it isn't real, I've always been interested in shows or movies with a supernatural twist to it. <br>

       The scene I've created is based on one of my favorite shows, Supernatural, and it's a reference to two different scenes in the show. The first scene <br>      starts with the background and the shooting stars, where the stars are supposedly angels that were dispelled from heaven. In the forefront of the <br>      image is an angel that appears to be entering from another dimension, but is actually Lucifer, the fallen angel and the antagonist of the show. The <br>      dimension he left is purgatory, which was a temporary imprisonment for him, and the dog besides him is a referrence to the creatures of purgatory <br>      that have also escaped into the world.</h5></p></pre>
